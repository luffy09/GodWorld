# 🌍 GodWorld

**GodWorld** is a playful, chaos-driven world simulator API built in Go. It allows you to create, retrieve, mutate, and destroy entities — but beware! A random chance of "chaos" can cause unpredictable behavior, such as random creations, deletions, or mutations.

It also features a Swagger-powered UI for exploring the API interactively.
